# Beach Parking Prototype
A prototype of the beach parking application being developed as a senior project at Florida Gulf Coast University. The prototype allows you to navigate through one real beach and a few mock beach information screens. The prototype was developed using flutter. The debug APK can be run on an android device if you have one, or an example of the program being run on an emulator can be seen as a gif below.
