# Beach Parking Prototype
A prototype of the beach parking application being developed as a senior project at Florida Gulf Coast University. The prototype allows you to navigate through one real beach and a few mock beach information screens. The prototype was developed using flutter. The debug APK (listed as APP-DEBUG.apk) can be run on an android device if you have one, or an example of the program being run on an emulator can be seen as an mp4 below. Unfortunately I could not test the iOS version due to not having an iPhone.
